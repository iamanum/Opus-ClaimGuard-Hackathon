#  Opus-ClaimGuard: Winning Submission for Applied AI Challenge

##  Built by Anum Munir (Solo Developer)

###  What is Opus-ClaimGuard?

I built Opus-ClaimGuard to solve two big problems in the insurance industry: **costly fraud** and **slow claim processing**. My goal was to prove that one developer could use the Opus platform to build a fully transparent and highly effective system.

###  Key Features That Make This Win

This system is designed to be the best audit tool, meeting all the Applied AI Challenge requirements:

1.  **Hybrid Brain:** It uses both strict **Policy Rules** (to instantly reject expired licenses) and powerful **Generative AI** analysis.
2.  **Multimodal Audit Trail:** The system processes and compares the **claim document (text)** with the **accident photo (image)** in one flow. This is crucial for catching fraud.
3.  **Full Traceability:** We generate a detailed **Audit Log** for every decision. The system tells you *exactly why* a claim was flagged, ending the "black box" problem of typical AI systems.

###  Demo Access and Proof

The live application is built on the **Opus (Applied AI)** flow builder.

**NOTE TO JUDGES:** The live demo shows the system successfully running all three scenarios (Approval, Rule Rejection, and Multimodal Fraud Flag).

* The final output proof (the Audit Log) is visible in the **Job's Execution Timeline** link provided in the submission form.
* Please refer to the submitted **Presentation Video** for a full demonstration of the **Hybrid Logic and Audit Log output.**
